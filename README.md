Project0 Assignment for CS50 Web Development Course from Edx.org


This is my submission for the CS50 Web Programming course, Project0.

The website has 5 html pages, 1 index and 4 others viz, ds, py,sc & web-dev.

There is also the sass style sheet named mystyle.scss.

Please note: Github didnt automatically covert the .scss file to .css to have to pre-complie and upload.

Also the web pages doesnt exactly reflects all the styles when hosted in github. but locally everything looks fine.

Many Thanks for this woderful course and taking the time to reivew this.

Best Regards,
deejax
